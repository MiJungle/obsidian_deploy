### Question
You are given an integer array `piles` where `piles[i]` is the number of bananas in the `ith` pile. You are also given an integer `h`, which represents the number of hours you have to eat all the bananas.

You may decide your bananas-per-hour eating rate of `k`. Each hour, you may choose a pile of bananas and eats `k` bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than `k` bananas, you may finish eating the pile but you can not eat from another pile in the same hour.

Return the minimum integer `k` such that you can eat all the bananas within `h` hours.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: piles = [1,4,3,2], h = 9

Output: 2
```


Explanation: With an eating rate of 2, you can eat the bananas in 6 hours. With an eating rate of 1, you would need 10 hours to eat all the bananas (which exceeds h=9), thus the minimum eating rate is 2.

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: piles = [25,10,23,4], h = 4

Output: 25
```


**Constraints:**

- `1 <= piles.length <= 1,000`
- `piles.length <= h <= 1,000,000`
- `1 <= piles[i] <= 1,000,000,000`


### Solution

**1. Binary Search Solution**

**Explanation:**

- Koko's eating speed `k` must be between `1` (minimum speed) and the maximum number of bananas in any pile.
- Use binary search to find the minimum speed `k` such that Koko can eat all the bananas within `h` hours.
- For each candidate `k`, calculate the total hours required to eat all bananas and adjust the binary search range based on the result.

**Implementation (JavaScript):**

```javascript
function minEatingSpeed(piles, h) {
    let left = 1; // Minimum possible speed
    let right = Math.max(...piles); // Maximum possible speed

    // Helper function to calculate hours needed at a given speed
    function hoursNeeded(speed) {
        return piles.reduce((totalHours, pile) => {
            return totalHours + Math.ceil(pile / speed);
        }, 0);
    }

    while (left < right) {
        let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        if (hoursNeeded(mid) <= h) {
            right = mid; // Try a slower speed
        } else {
            left = mid + 1; // Increase the speed
        }
    }

    return left; // Minimum speed at which Koko can eat all bananas in h hours
}
```

**Time Complexity:**

- `O(n log m)`:
    - `O(log m)` for the binary search, where `m` is the range of possible speeds (`1` to `max(piles)`).
    - `O(n)` for calculating the total hours needed for each candidate speed.

**Space Complexity:**

- `O(1)` since no additional data structures are used.

**Advantage:**

- Efficient and scales well with larger inputs due to logarithmic search.

**2. Brute Force Solution (Not Recommended for Large Inputs)**

**Explanation:**

- Try every possible eating speed from `1` to the maximum number of bananas in any pile.
- For each speed, calculate the total hours required to eat all bananas and return the smallest speed that satisfies the `h` constraint.

**Implementation (JavaScript):**

```javascript
function minEatingSpeed(piles, h) {
    let maxPile = Math.max(...piles);

    // Helper function to calculate hours needed at a given speed
    function hoursNeeded(speed) {
        return piles.reduce((totalHours, pile) => {
            return totalHours + Math.ceil(pile / speed);
        }, 0);
    }

    for (let speed = 1; speed <= maxPile; speed++) {
        if (hoursNeeded(speed) <= h) {
            return speed;
        }
    }

    return maxPile; // If no speed satisfies, return max pile (worst case)
}
```

**Time Complexity:**

- `O(n * m)`:
    - `O(m)` for iterating over all possible speeds (`1` to `max(piles)`).
    - `O(n)` for calculating the total hours for each speed.

**Space Complexity:**

- `O(1)` since no additional data structures are used.

**Drawback:**

- Inefficient for larger inputs due to the high time complexity.

### Summary of Approaches:

|Approach|Time Complexity|Space Complexity|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|Binary Search|`O(n log m)`|`O(1)`|Optimal and efficient for large datasets.|
|Brute Force|`O(n * m)`|`O(1)`|Simple but impractical for large inputs.|

**Binary Search Solution** is the recommended approach as it efficiently determines the minimum eating speed with optimal complexity.
