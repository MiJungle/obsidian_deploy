### Question
You are given an array non-negative integers `heights` which represent an elevation map. Each value `heights[i]` represents the height of a bar, which has a width of `1`.

Return the maximum area of water that can be trapped between the bars.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: height = [0,2,0,3,1,0,1,3,2,1]

Output: 9
```

Copy

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= height.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 1000`

### Solution
To solve the "Trapping Rain Water" problem, we want to calculate how much water can be trapped between the bars of varying heights after it rains. There are several approaches to tackle this problem, with the two-pointer technique being one of the most efficient.

### Problem Summary
Given an array `height` where `height[i]` represents the height of the `i-th` bar, calculate how much water can be trapped after raining.

#### Example:
Input:
```plaintext
height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
```
Output:
```plaintext
6
```
Explanation: Water can be trapped above the bars at indices 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, and 10.

### Approach 1: Two-Pointer Technique

1. **Initialize two pointers**: `left` starting at the beginning and `right` starting at the end of the array. Also, maintain two variables `left_max` and `right_max` to track the maximum heights from both sides.
2. **Iterate until the pointers meet**:
   - If `height[left]` is less than `height[right]`, then the trapped water at `left` is determined by `left_max`. If `height[left]` is greater than `left_max`, update `left_max`; otherwise, calculate the water trapped and add it to the total.
   - If `height[right]` is less than or equal to `height[left]`, perform similar operations for the right pointer.
3. The total amount of water trapped is accumulated during the iteration.

**Time Complexity**: `O(n)`  
**Space Complexity**: `O(1)`

**Implementation (JavaScript)**:

```javascript
function trap(height) {
    let left = 0, right = height.length - 1;
    let left_max = 0, right_max = 0;
    let waterTrapped = 0;

    while (left < right) {
        if (height[left] < height[right]) {
            if (height[left] >= left_max) {
                left_max = height[left];
            } else {
                waterTrapped += left_max - height[left];
            }
            left++;
        } else {
            if (height[right] >= right_max) {
                right_max = height[right];
            } else {
                waterTrapped += right_max - height[right];
            }
            right--;
        }
    }

    return waterTrapped;
}
```

### Explanation of Each Step:

- **Pointers and Max Heights**: The two-pointer technique allows us to scan from both ends towards the center, updating maximum heights efficiently without using extra space for another array.
- **Water Calculation**: By comparing the current bar height with the maximum heights recorded, we can easily determine how much water can be trapped at that position.

---

### Approach 2: Dynamic Programming (Array Method)

This method involves precomputing the maximum heights to the left and right of each bar and using this information to calculate the trapped water.

1. **Create two arrays**: `left_max` and `right_max`, where `left_max[i]` contains the maximum height from the left up to index `i`, and `right_max[i]` contains the maximum height from the right.
2. **Iterate through the `height` array** to fill both `left_max` and `right_max`.
3. **Calculate the water trapped** at each index as the minimum of the two maximum heights minus the height at that index.

**Time Complexity**: `O(n)`  
**Space Complexity**: `O(n)`

**Implementation (JavaScript)**:

```javascript
function trap(height) {
    if (height.length === 0) return 0;

    const left_max = new Array(height.length);
    const right_max = new Array(height.length);
    let waterTrapped = 0;

    left_max[0] = height[0];
    for (let i = 1; i < height.length; i++) {
        left_max[i] = Math.max(left_max[i - 1], height[i]);
    }

    right_max[height.length - 1] = height[height.length - 1];
    for (let i = height.length - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        right_max[i] = Math.max(right_max[i + 1], height[i]);
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < height.length; i++) {
        waterTrapped += Math.min(left_max[i], right_max[i]) - height[i];
    }

    return waterTrapped;
}
```

### Summary of Approaches

| Approach                | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Description                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Two-Pointer Technique    | `O(n)`          | `O(1)`           | Efficiently calculates trapped water with minimal space. |
| Dynamic Programming (Array Method) | `O(n)` | `O(n)` | Uses extra space to store maximum heights for calculation. |

### Preferred Solution
The **Two-Pointer Technique** is preferred due to its efficiency in both time and space. It effectively calculates the trapped water without the need for additional arrays, making it suitable for larger inputs.

This implementation strategy effectively allows you to compute the amount of trapped rainwater between bars of different heights in an optimal manner.
