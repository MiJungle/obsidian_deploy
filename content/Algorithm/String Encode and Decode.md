### Question
Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a single string. The encoded string is then decoded back to the original list of strings.

Please implement `encode` and `decode`

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: ["neet","code","love","you"]

Output:["neet","code","love","you"]
```

Copy

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: ["we","say",":","yes"]

Output: ["we","say",":","yes"]
```

Copy

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= strs.length < 100`
- `0 <= strs[i].length < 200`
- `strs[i]` contains only UTF-8 characters.


### Solution
To design an algorithm to encode and decode a list of strings, here are three different approaches, progressively optimizing in complexity and efficiency.

### 1. **Simple Delimiter-Based Solution**

**Explanation**:  
- Use a delimiter character (like `#`) to separate each string. For example, to encode the strings `["neet", "code"]`, we could produce a single string `"neet#code"`.
- For decoding, split the encoded string by the delimiter to reconstruct the original list.
  
**Challenges**:  
This approach fails if the delimiter itself is present in any of the strings, as it would cause incorrect splitting. 

**Implementation (JavaScript)**:

```javascript
function encode(strs) {
    return strs.join('#');
}

function decode(s) {
    return s.split('#');
}
```

**Time Complexity**:
- **Encoding**: `O(n * m)`, where `n` is the number of strings and `m` is the average length of each string.
- **Decoding**: `O(n * m)`, since splitting the string and iterating are linear.

**Space Complexity**:
- **Encoding**: `O(n * m)`, storing the concatenated string.
- **Decoding**: `O(n * m)`, storing the split strings.

**Drawback**: Doesn’t handle strings containing the delimiter.

### 2. **Length-Prefix Encoding**

**Explanation**:  
- Encode each string by prefixing it with its length and a special separator. For example, `["neet", "code"]` becomes `"4#neet4#code"`.
- To decode, read each length-prefix, extract the string of that length, and continue until the entire string is processed.

**Implementation (JavaScript)**:

```javascript
function encode(strs) {
    let encoded = "";
    for (let str of strs) {
        encoded += str.length + "#" + str;
    }
    return encoded;
}

function decode(s) {
    const decoded = [];
    let i = 0;

    while (i < s.length) {
        let j = i;
        while (s[j] !== "#") {
            j++;
        }
        const length = parseInt(s.substring(i, j));
        i = j + 1;
        decoded.push(s.substring(i, i + length));
        i += length;
    }

    return decoded;
}
```

**Time Complexity**:
- **Encoding**: `O(n * m)`, iterating through all strings and their lengths.
- **Decoding**: `O(n * m)`, traversing the encoded string and parsing the lengths and substrings.

**Space Complexity**:
- **Encoding**: `O(n * m)`, storing the encoded string.
- **Decoding**: `O(n * m)`, storing the decoded strings.

**Advantage**: Handles strings with special characters and delimiters.

---

### 3. **Base64 Encoding**

**Explanation**:  
- This solution encodes each string in Base64 format, using a non-Base64 character as a delimiter. It can be decoded by splitting each Base64-encoded segment and then decoding each.
- This method is efficient for handling complex character sets, including UTF-8.

**Implementation (JavaScript)**:

```javascript
function encode(strs) {
    return strs.map(str => btoa(str)).join(' ');
}

function decode(s) {
    return s.split(' ').map(str => atob(str));
}
```

**Time Complexity**:
- **Encoding**: `O(n * m)`, where `n` is the number of strings, and `m` is the average length after Base64 encoding.
- **Decoding**: `O(n * m)`, splitting and decoding Base64.

**Space Complexity**:
- **Encoding**: `O(n * m)`, storing the Base64-encoded strings.
- **Decoding**: `O(n * m)`, storing the decoded strings.

**Advantage**: Handles any characters, including UTF-8, and avoids issues with custom delimiters.

### Summary of Approaches:

| Approach                | Time Complexity (Encode) | Time Complexity (Decode) | Space Complexity       | Description                                      |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Delimiter-Based Solution | `O(n * m)`               | `O(n * m)`               | `O(n * m)`             | Simple join/split method, but can fail with delimiter collisions. |
| Length-Prefix Encoding   | `O(n * m)`               | `O(n * m)`               | `O(n * m)`             | Uses length prefixes, handles special characters.  |
| Base64 Encoding          | `O(n * m)`               | `O(n * m)`               | `O(n * m)`             | Uses Base64 encoding to avoid character conflicts. |

**Best Solution**: For most cases, **Length-Prefix Encoding** provides simplicity and robustness without additional encoding overhead.
