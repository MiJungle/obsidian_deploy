[[JavaScript]] can't read Chrome's auto-fill password field until the page is interacted with by the user.

The reason is, that events have the isTrusted property. "The isTrusted read-only property of the Event interface is a Boolean that is true when the event was generated by a user action, and false when the event was created or modified by a script or dispatched via EventTarget.dispatchEvent()." (fromÂ [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/isTrusted](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/isTrusted)).

Chrome autofill values only become readable with a isTrusted=true event.

Even if with setTimeout method, cannot get the value that is autofilled.
